# Dead Zone Demo

This is a demonstration to go along with the blog post at https://blog.khutchins.com/posts/phaser-3-inputs-ab/ that contains a few different ways to implement dead zones for input axes.

## Setup

I haven't tested these steps myself, but running this should be as simple as:

1. Run `npm install` in the base directory.
2. Run `npm run dev` to run a local version of the game.
